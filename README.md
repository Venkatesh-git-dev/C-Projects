# C Projects Repository

This repository contains various C projects that I have created for my own learning purposes. Each project is maintained in its own branch to keep the codebase organized. All projects here are free to use and modify according to my needs.

## Projects

1. **Tic Tac Toe Game**: A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C. (Branch: tic_tac_toe)

I will continue to add more projects to this repository as I create them.
